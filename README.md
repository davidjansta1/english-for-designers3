# **07 Year in review**

The last 12 months of my life were kinda interesting I guess.

It wasn't a good year for me at all. I wasn't that productive and did almost nothing.

But let's be positive. I will write about my work, school, and free time life.

I can't say everything because it would be too long but I will at least mention one thing from each category I considered as important, lifechanging or at least interesting.

Let's start with the first topic. And that:

## **School:**

It's hard to say the best moment. 

Of course, these English lessons were actually really entertaining and full of value.

But I have probably one moment from school I liked the most.

It was a visit to a sound effects studio. I extremely liked that presentation. I think that sounds are extremely important in video production and I wanted to get as much value as possible from it because there are no rules in here. So I listened really closely. There was also a huge painting I kinda liked and it inspired me to start painting with acrylics. Then we also had some nice town adventure with my classmates and it was overall a nice school day.


## **Work:**

Another topic is work and I will mention just the most interesting thing from my work life.

I'm not sure about this one.

There were more things on a similar level but I will probably mention filming the Hackathon event.

There were many things I learned from this event.

It was a 3-day long event about AI and I was filming it in a nice building.

I would say this was a great experience overall.

I'm not really using my camera that much.

Just a few times a year.

Because most of the things I do are behind computer.

But this was a long event filmed on my filming camera it's just not that suitable for events.

So it was a challenge.

But pretty interesting one.


## **Free time:**

And the last category is my free time.

I would say the most memorable event was a Blink-182 concert in Prague.

It was just a beautiful experience seeing them live.

The show was just mindblowing.

I'm sure it was the best concert I've ever been to.

It was also the first time I've been in the O2 arena and it was a shock how small it was in real life. 

From photos, it always looked way bigger.


Thats all. I wish you a wonderful day.
